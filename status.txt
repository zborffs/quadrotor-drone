Day 1:

- next steps, discretize the plant (see how sampled-data system performs)

- start with system identification techniques with MATLAB... see if we can estimate the different coefficients of the model...

- figure out the trajectory / the experiment to measure all the IO relationships

- next steps, add in wind disturbances (white noise with non-zero mean and std deviation, small) -> look at spectrum; look into metrics for rejection of this... look at how this would be analyzed (TF, rejection of certain frequencies)

- see how the wind distrubances affected our ability to do system identification techniques...

- add in noise disturbances (white noise with zero mean); look at spectrum; look into metrics for rejection of this... how much noise until we go unstable?; look at how this can be analyzed

- system identification techniques from MATLAB... see if we can determine coeffficients of the system as well as if we can estimate the spectrum / amount of sensor noise and disturbances...

- add in gain uncertainty in the measurements

- system identification techniques from MATLAB to measure everything...

- at this point, we should know if it's possible to estimate the basic gain uncertainties etc. just from sitting there...

- figure out some realistic specifications for the controller

- design H-infinity controller to meet specifications subject to constraints of exogenous disturbances and uncertainty...   
More sophisticated controllers
------------------------------
- add more sophisticated (adaptive) methods for estimating biases and coefficients in real-time in tandem with the h-infinity controller; take what we now should understand about estimating coeffs and biases from repeated system identification procedures...

- do a final write up of the whole thing...
