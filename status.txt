Day 1:
======
- taking stock of where I am... looks like we got a non-linear model of the plant, we have a linearized model of the plant... the linearized model is fully controllable, but requires an observer to understand pick up on the velocity of the plant (plus there is bias and noise everywhere)...

- next steps, assume all coefficients are just '1'

- next steps, implement a simulation + animation framework to test the linear plant model and the non-linear plant model

- create a controller to stabilize the system using LQR / pole-placement for the observer and the feedback controller with integral feedback

- add in maximum control effort per rotor

- next steps, discretize the plant (see how sampled-data system performs)

- start with system identification techniques with MATLAB... see if we can estimate the different coefficients of the model...

- figure out the trajectory / the experiment to measure all the IO relationships

- next steps, add in wind disturbances (white noise with non-zero mean and std deviation, small) -> look at spectrum; look into metrics for rejection of this... look at how this would be analyzed (TF, rejection of certain frequencies)

- see how the wind distrubances affected our ability to do system identification techniques...

- add in noise disturbances (white noise with zero mean); look at spectrum; look into metrics for rejection of this... how much noise until we go unstable?; look at how this can be analyzed

- system identification techniques from MATLAB... see if we can determine coeffficients of the system as well as if we can estimate the spectrum / amount of sensor noise and disturbances...

- add in gain uncertainty in the measurements

- system identification techniques from MATLAB to measure everything...

- at this point, we should know if it's possible to estimate the basic gain uncertainties etc. just from sitting there...

- figure out some realistic specifications for the controller

- design H-infinity controller to meet specifications subject to constraints of exogenous disturbances and uncertainty...   


More sophisticated controllers
------------------------------
- add more sophisticated (adaptive) methods for estimating biases and coefficients in real-time in tandem with the h-infinity controller; take what we now should understand about estimating coeffs and biases from repeated system identification procedures...

- do a final write up of the whole thing...
